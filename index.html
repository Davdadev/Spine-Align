    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      What is the issue/s we are trying to fix?
      Many serious short- and long-term problems faced by individuals around the world, including lifelong back pain, muscle straining, and even a decrease in potential height, can all be traced down to one[...]
      <br><br>
      Why did we choose this project?
      We chose this project because Neil’s mother works in a disability center (Nulsen) where there are many people who not only suffer from minute effects of maintenance of a poor posture. This really sh[...]
      <br><br>
      What is our solution to this problem, how is it effective?
      Our prototype presents an effective, simple, affordable, and efficient solution to such an immense problem. We are going to design a device that can be worn daily under clothing. The device uses an Ar[...]
      <br><br>
      What are some similar products and why is ours different?
      Other posture-correcting products exist, but each has clear flaws: braces physically pull the spine straight yet are uncomfortable for daily wear and can weaken muscles by doing all the work; smart we[...]
    </p>
    <h3>Aims</h3>
    <p>
      To build a wearable device that corrects posture by monitoring the angle of the back and neck and providing a gentle auditory alert when poor posture is maintained for more than two minutes. Buildi[...]

    <h3>Product Materials</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Core Electronic Components:</strong><br>
      Arduino Pro Mini (5V recommended for simplicity), MPU6050 accelerometer/gyroscope module,<br>
      Sound system / buzzer (small piezo or speaker, rated for Arduino voltage), Mini slide switch (ON/OFF),<br>
      Power Bank, to keep the device running when on back (lightweight),<br>
      Buck/boost converter (only if needed for voltage adjustment — usually not required)
      <br><br>
      <strong>Wiring & Assembly Parts:</strong><br>
      Jumper wires or thin flexible silicone-coated small plastic enclosure or 3D-printed casing,<br>
      Velcro straps or elastic bands (for attaching to body/clothing), Sewing kit or fabric glue (if embedding in clothing),<br>
      Hot glue gun (to secure components in casing)
      <br><br>
      <strong>Programming & Setup:</strong><br>
      USB-to-Serial adapter (FTDI) for programming Arduino Pro Mini,<br>
      Computer with Arduino IDE installed, MPU6050 Arduino library (Jeff Rowberg’s version recommended)

    </p>
    <h3>Evaluation</h3>
    <p>
      When we set out to make our product, we quickly ran into challenges with programming. The coding and technology behind the device were more advanced than we had expected, especially since we didn’t have much experience. While it works, the device is more fragile than we had hoped. It can get damaged easily and needs a strong casing, like cardboard or a 3D-printed cover, for protection. The MPU6050 sensor also isn’t as robust as we would like. Looking back, we’ve learned a lot. We now understand the importance of carefully weighing all options before choosing a solution, especially in areas where we don’t have much experience, and not diving in blindly.
