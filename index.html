    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>What is the issue/s we are trying to fix?<br>
Many serious short- and long-term problems faced by individuals around the world, including lifelong back pain, muscle straining, and even a decrease in potential height, can all be traced down to one root: the regular practice of maintaining poor posture. Poor posture occurs when the spinal cord is not in its natural position, putting extra pressure on bones, joints, and muscles. Over time, this uneven distribution of pressure causes the muscles that support the spine to weaken and strain, the spinal discs (the soft cushions between the bones of the spine that act as shock absorbers) to compress, and the natural curve of the back to shift away from its ideal alignment. These changes not only make daily movement more painful but also restrict proper blood flow and nerve function. Around 619 million people worldwide live with lower back pain, making it the leading cause of disability globally. That figure is projected to rise to approximately 843 million by 2050 due to population growth. Starting around age 40, individuals lose about 1cm due to natural factors like spine compression (when the bones of the spine press too tightly together), bone density loss (bones becoming thinner and weaker), and muscle decline (muscles losing strength and size), all of which are made worse and accelerated by poor posture. Approximately 1.4 billion people suffer from stunting of potential height as the vertebrae (the small bones that make up the spine) and discs remain under prolonged stress, never reaching their full capacity for growth. Posture also causes conditions such as osteoporosis (a disease where bones become weak and break easily), spinal fractures (breaks or cracks in the bones of the spine), and postural change (when the natural shape or curve of the back permanently shifts) because the body is forced to adapt unnaturally to a position it was never designed to maintain. From the above we can tell that the fixing of this small factor could be the solution to so many severe problems.<br><br>
Why did we choose this project?<br>
We chose this project because Neil’s mother works in a disability center (Nulsen) where there are many people who not only suffer from minute effects of maintenance of a poor posture. This really shook us and changed our view on the severity of the issue, it also made us determined to find a solution to such serious repercussions of this effect on many occasions. We also feel that this is an issue which can be easily corrected with the help of our invention, it can easily solve this serious issue without increasing too many changes in daily routine and doesn’t feel as if it is a burden either.<br><br>
What is our solution to this problem, how is it effective?<br>
Our prototype presents an effective, simple, affordable, and efficient solution to such an immense problem. We are going to design a device that can be worn daily under clothing. The device uses an Arduino Pro Mini and an MPU6050 accelerometer sensor to measure the angle of the back and neck, ensuring the spinal cord is within its ideal range of position. If the wearer maintains incorrect or non-ideal posture for over two minutes while sitting or standing, the device will beep through its small sound system, acting as a biochemical reminder to maintain correct posture and, in the long term, potentially avoid such problems, our device will also easily be able to be removed and put back on.<br><br>
What are some similar products and why is ours different?<br>
Other posture-correcting products exist, but each has clear flaws: braces physically pull the spine straight yet are uncomfortable for daily wear and can weaken muscles by doing all the work; smart wearables like Upright GO or Lumo Lift use sensors but cost over $100, rely on constant charging and smartphone apps, and often feel invasive; and ergonomic chairs or standing desks are effective only in fixed environments and are far too expensive for most people. In contrast, Spine Align is original in combining the accuracy of sensor-based feedback with the simplicity and affordability of a wearable device that works independently of apps or restrictive designs. Instead of forcing posture, it gently reminds the user through sound when slouching, which not only prevents problems like back pain, spinal compression, and long-term disability but also builds lasting healthy habits. It is also only not as expensive to produce as others (it’s not that cheap either!). Its originality lies in offering a solution that is portable, comfortable, affordable, and habit-forming — a balance that existing products fail to achieve, making Spine Align a more practical and effective answer to one of the world’s most widespread health issues.
</p>
    <h3>Aims</h3>
    <p>To build a wearable device that corrects posture by monitoring the angle of the back and neck and providing a gentle auditory alert when poor posture is maintained for more than two minutes. Building materials are an Arduino Pro Mini, an MPU6050 accelerometer/gyroscope sensor, a small buzzer, a power bank, jumper wires, and a casing with straps to attach the device comfortably to the wearer. We predict that this device will effectively encourage users to maintain correct posture, helping prevent long-term issues such as back pain, spinal compression, and stunted growth, while remaining comfortable and easy to use during daily activities.

    <h3>Sketch</h3>
    <img src="Screenshot 2025-08-20 201614.png" alt="Device Screenshot"/>
    <p>Explanation of Sketch<br>The sketch effectively shows the design and placement of Spine Align on the back, clearly identifying the Arduino Pro Mini, MPU6050 sensor, buzzer, and wiring connections. Arrows and labels illustrate component functions and integration, making the device’s operation easy to understand. While the sketch is informative and precise, highlighting the buzzer more clearly and showing wire connections slightly more distinctly could further improve clarity for someone building the device. Overall, it provides a strong visual guide that supports comprehension of the device’s structure and functionality.

    <h3>Overall Review on my product</h3>
    <p>All things considered, the product successfully combines all the parts and encourages proper back posture.  Under supervision, programming and technical difficulties were resolved, enabling troubleshooting and innovative modifications.  But the gadget is brittle, the sensor is a little inaccurate, and it depends on all its parts to work.  Although functionality was attained, resilience and durability were not adequately considered.
</p>
    <h3>Evaluation</h3>
    <p>When we set out to make our product, we quickly ran into challenges with programming. The coding and technology behind the device were more advanced than we had expected, especially since we didn’t have much prior experience. To get started, we reached out to teachers, parents, and friends who had experience in electronics and coding. Their advice and guidance were helpful and gave us the confidence to begin our project. Even after getting past the first hurdles, we ran into more problems, particularly with coding the Arduino Pro Mini, which is the heart of the device. With persistence, collaboration, and a lot of trial and error, we eventually got it working. After a few adjustments and improvisations, we finally had a device that did what we intended: helping people maintain correct back posture.<br><br>
While it works, the device is more fragile than we had hoped. It can get damaged easily and needs a strong casing, like cardboard or a 3D-printed cover, for protection. The MPU6050 sensor also isn’t perfectly accurate; for example, the buzzer might go off at 22–25° instead of exactly 20°. Everything in the device is closely linked, so if one part isn’t connected properly, the whole thing stops working.<br><br>
Looking back, we’ve learned a lot. We now understand the importance of carefully weighing all options before choosing a solution, especially in areas where we don’t have much experience, and not depending too heavily on others. We’ve also realized that there’s more to think about than just whether something works durability, reliability, and usability are equally important. These lessons will help us improve future versions of the device, making it stronger, more efficient, and easier for people to use.
